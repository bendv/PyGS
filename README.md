# Python for Geo-Spatial Analysis

Tutorials and course materials in development.

To install the dependencies using conda in a separate environment, run the following in your terminal (use the Anaconda Prompt if on Windows):

```bash
conda create -n pygs
conda activate pygs
conda install jupyter rasterio scikit-learn scipy rasterio geopandas matplotlib
```

These tutorials are written using `jupyter`. There are many tutorials on jupyter online. For example, [this article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) gives a nice introduction to the concept of jupyter notebooks.
