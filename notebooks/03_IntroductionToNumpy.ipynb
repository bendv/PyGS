    "# Numerical Python (NumPy)\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` is an extremely powerful python library for manipulating arrays and matrices. It plays an important role in geospatial analysis because we can model image data as multidimensional arrays. For example, a single-band (e.g., panchromatic) image can be stored in memory as a 2-dimensional array, with dimensions corresponding to the number of rows and columns in the image. Similarly, a multispectral image (e.g., a Landsat image with 6 spectral bands) can be stored in memory as a 3-dimensional array, with the dimensions corresponding to the number of bands, the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively. In the latter case, you can think of the multispectral image as a \"stack\" of 2-D arrays, one array for each spectral band. Before we get into image analysis, we'll need to cover some basic concepts in `numpy`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll gain experience with the following concepts:  \n",
    "* array dimensions  \n",
    "* array slicing  \n",
    "* array indexing  \n",
    "* array algebra  \n",
    "* data types in `numpy` \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the `numpy` library. Since we'll be referring to it so often, it will be convenient to define a shorthand for the library - `np`. In a few cases, we'll plot the array data using the `matplotlib.pyplot` library. `matplotlib` is a *very* feature-rich plotting library, and the intention of this tutorial is not to get into details on plotting."
